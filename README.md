# Image classify using own images with tensorflow


###Main Idea:
  This is about using your own images(JPEG or PNG) and created labels with tensorflow.
  
###Steps for studying:
  
|step|To do|
|------|----|
|1|Understand the key concepts|
|2|Understand the basic tutorial in Tensorflow(MNIST)|
|3|Modify the basic tutorial (MNIST) to output the prediction and each of the labels possibility |
|4|Reformat the images(JPEG or PNG) to the specification format|
|5|Using step three's function to output the result|


####Step one:
#####*Using google or baidu or anything you can, try to search everything about the four key words that we will use in this project.*
  Key Concept:
  * Deep Learning & Neural Network
  * Softmax Regression 
  * Gradient descent
  * CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)

####Review:
#####*Pleae use your own language to illustrate:*
  
  (If you can make the others who never hear these concepts to understand with a simple example, that mean you had already understand these.)
  * What is the Deep learning & Neural Network
  * How to create the Softmax Regression Model 
  * What does the Gradient descent usage doing
  * Please make a simple demonstration to explain what is the CNN and what is the biggest feature of it. 
  
  
  
####Step two:
#####*Go to The tensorflow tutorial website and download the original the code and try to understand each of line.*

  You may follow some steps in here to understand more about the tensorflow
